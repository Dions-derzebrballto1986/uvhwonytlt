OMG, just stumblrd out of the theater. Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare - like, what just happened in there?? Felt like my brain went through a kaleidoscope mixer. Popcorn stuck to my sleeve, btw. Should clean this up... Anyway, Tinker Bell was a bloody banshee, glowing like a firefly on steroids, screeching through the chaos. Can fairies even do that? Her wings flapping like a hyperactive bat. My back’s killing me from those seats, but whatever, right?

Honestly, Hook was the star, not even kidding. The way he twirled that hook hand - like, the ballerina of the seas, if ballerinas wore pirate boots and had, you know, hooks for hands. Remember they asked to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , might as well after this. The crocodile though, terrifying, like Jaws but with more teeth—and a monocle? Why did it have a monocle? And somehow not as realistic as my neighbor's chihuahua in a sweater, but in a room crazed w neon colors it just... fit. No idea how.

> In the middle of chaos there was an oddly quiet moment where Pan sat on a cloud, looked down, and said lines I swear I've heard in a fortune cookie. Theater was super noisy around me. People behind me whispered loud enough I could rehearse their conversation, popcorn crushing underfoot like the sound of Neverland's collapsing forests or something. Did Peter Pan just quote Confucius? “Fly, fly away but remember the path back” — did they pull that from a fridge magnet?

The Lost Boys were more like the Lost College Kids on spring break, rampaging and meddling. I think one wore a beanie with reindeer antlers? Gonna have to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 that bit. Oh, oh, and the scene where the mermaids threw glitter grenades at the pirate ship? What was even happening? I swear it was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a bizarre, nautical disco with rage issues.

Did I remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with a friend or did I dream that too? It's like stepping into Van Gogh’s Starry Night with a side of epic doom—a coordination of beauty and panic attack at once. Unicorns could’ve started break dancing on the deck, and it would've felt natural. Not sure if it was the   or the combo of that enormous soda I drank. Still, pretty sure this one’s one to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when it's out. You know, for... science?

You know, Wendy’s speech toward the end was deep but also felt like she was auditioning for a reality show confession bit? “In a world full of pirates, be the lighthouse,” or whatever it was. This was an explosion of twisted fairy tales and accidentally stepping on the nearest Lego—painful, memorable, and inexplicably worth it. I can still smell the butter.

Alright, totally spaced out again, but... oh well, CANNOT explain half of what I just saw but I mean, code or something here:
```python
def follow_peter_pan(wind, shadow):
    if wind.warm and shadow.lost:
        return 'Off to Neverland!'
# I mean honestly... does it even matter what this does?
